        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Bubble, takes place in a dystopian future, where the repercussions of climate change have dramatically altered the natural world. Since the start of the 22nd century, environmental conditions have deteriorated, making the Earth's surface largely uninhabitable. This unprecedented ecological collapse, driven by relentless industrial expansion, climate change, and resource depletion, has forced humanity to retreat into controlled, underground habitats. For generations humanity has grown up with only digital archives and photographs to hint at our planet's once-vibrant ecosystems.
            It is within this context that Bubble has emerged. </p>
        <p>Founded by a powerful coalition of technologists and corporate interests, including major funding from Shell, Bubble acts as a controversial player in the response to the environmental crisis. This platform, leveraging cutting-edge virtual reality (VR) technology, simulates pristine natural environments for a select few. Accessible only to the elite, Bubble offers an exclusive escape from the harsh realities of a deteriorating world, encapsulating the divide between the privileged and the less fortunate.</p>
        <p>Despite the overwhelming evidence and the documented continuous rise in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, societal response has been notably inadequate. The resulting acceleration in global carbon dioxide emissions leaves humanity with three stark choices: mitigation, adaptation, and suffering. Thompson's research not only underscores the urgent need for global action against climate change but also serves as a clarion call to address this escalating crisis through concerted efforts in mitigation and adaptation strategies.</p>

                <li>Reduced feelings of isolation (because nothing says 'connected' like virtual trees)</li>
                <li>Diminished anxiety and depression symptoms (ignore the real world falling apart outside!)</li>
                <li>Decreased irritability and mood swings (except about the actual environment, which is ruined)</li>
                <li>Boosted endorphin and dopamine levels (simulated sunshine and fake birdsongs included!)</li>

        <p class="disclaimer">* These "benefits" are based on very optimistic projections. Actual natural environments may vary significantly, mainly because they no longer exist as we knew them, thanks to us. Proceed at your own disillusionment.</p>
